# Huffman-Coding
Huffman coding is the iconic algorithm developed by David Huffman in 1951. It is used for calculating minimum cost prefix free codes. This work by Dr Huffman represented a significant turning point in the creation of effective information representation techniques. 

This algorithm has affected numerous of the widely used coding and compression schemes in modern gadgets like digital cameras, music players, software distribution tools, and methods for archiving documents. 

For this we need to know the techniques for encoding a single character, a string and then reading a file and encoding each string/symbol that it contains.
For this purpose, I used the tree data structure and implemented Huffman coding. I arranged the frequencies in ascending order and then add them to implement a tree. I then used this tree to assign codes to each character.

I have successfully implemented the above system and got a compression ratio of each string present in a text file
